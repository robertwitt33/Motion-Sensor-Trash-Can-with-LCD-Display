# Motion-Sensor-Trash-Can-with-LCD-Display

I completed this project a few months ago, however I never uploaded it to GitHub. This was the first major project that I did with my Arduino Kit. I emptied my trash can in my bathroom and used some old cardboard to replicate a lid. To open the lid, I taped a piece of floss to it and then tied the other end of the floss to the propeller of the Servo Motor. When the Ultrasonic Sensor on the side of the trash can detected motion, it would turn the propeller of the Servo Motor an appropriate amount to open or close the lid. The LCD display on the top of the can would display “OPENED” or “CLOSED” based on the state of the trash can.

For the coding aspect of this project, I was able to use the concept of state machines that I learn in my embedded systems class at school. I used “enum” to define the constants OPENED and CLOSED. When the main loop executes, it first checks if there is an object close enough to the Ultrasonic Sensor. If not, then nothing changes. However, if there is then the program will check the current state of the trash can, if it is currently opened, it will execute code to close it, such as decreasing the Servo Motor angle and displaying “CLOSED.” If the trash can is currently closed, code to open the trash can will fire. I added an error code that fires if neither state is active, which should never happen. My professor said this is healthy coding practice.
